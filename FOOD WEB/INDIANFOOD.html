		<p>It's one of the most difficult decisions you'll ever have to make: What to order at your favorite Indian restaurant. There are too many delicious options! The obvious answer is to show up with a group order for the whole table for everyone to share, family style.

Hopefully you stock your kitchen with some of the essential ingredients found in Indian cuisine so you can easily prepare your favorite restaurant dishes from the comfort of your own kitchen. Use this guide for your own cooking or as inspiration for ordering dishes out, too.
